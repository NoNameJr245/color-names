`Contributor Code of Conduct<http://contributor-covenant.org/>`_.

Guideslines for contributing
============================

* All color files must be JSON files.
* Validate your JSON with `JSON Lint <https://jsonlint.com>`_ before
  submitting.
* The JSON must be an object with color-names as the keys and a
  corresponding valid RGB hex string as the value.
* Color names must start with a lowercase letter.
* Color names can only contain letters and digits.
* RGB hex strings must start with a pound sign (#).
* The RGB value must be 3 or 6 hex characters long.
* It's preferrable to use pytest with Python to test your submission, but
  it is not required; Travis CI will automatically test it when it's
  committed.


.. Note::

This is a carefully curated list of color names, therefore it is advisable
to check to see if your collection of color names will be accepted prior to
putting the work in to get it ready for submission.
